or pass in more than one match file (e.g. different leagues or more seasons / years ):

```

```


Note: If the PostgreSQL database (and its tables, views & indices) do not (yet) exist, they get auto-created / auto-migrated on the first run.


Note: You can use `football2psql` as an alias / alternate name.


**Pipes & Standard Input (STDIN)**

You can use any command line tool to download match files and pipe (via stdin) into this tool like so:

```
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openfootball/world-cup/master/2018--russia/cup.txt | football-to-psql worldcup.db
```

That's it for now.




## Limitations

Note: For now you CANNOT update match files, that is,
if you try to add the same match twice (assuming with updated scores or such), the match reader will fail for now.
The workaround is to always re-create/re-build your database from zero / scratch for now.
